## Once a decorated commander,  
now a legend whispered in fear.

Before Sir Carrotbane the Compromiser ever became head of the red team battalion, it was Hopper who led them to victory after victory. In fact, there was one feat accomplished by Hopper that is very relevant to the current events in Wareville, although those memories remain locked away for now. This achievement earned Hopper his promotion to Colonel and placed him in command of the red team battalion.  
  
Shortly after this, King Malhare began taking credit for all Hopper had accomplished, rewriting history to present himself as both the ultimate ruler and the greatest red teamer. This infuriated Hopper. He tried to keep his head down and continue his work, but serving a King who lied and belittled him made his anger grow each day.  
  
The anger manifested as a persistent twitch. His soldiers noticed and began to snicker, eventually giving him the nickname "Colonel Panic." When word of this reached the royal court, King Malhare saw the perfect excuse to tarnish Hopper's reputation even further. He demoted Hopper, forcing him to serve as the court jester and turning him into a mockery. This humiliation only worsened Hopper's anger and his twitch.  
  
How could the King do this to him? After everything Hopper had done for HopSec Island and for the King, he was repaid by having his achievements stolen and his dignity stripped away. As the King became aware of Hopper's growing fury, he decided to lock him away on HopSec Island. It seemed his desire to humiliate Hopper knew no limits.  
  
This is where we find Hopper now, imprisoned on HopSec Island, biding his time and waiting for the moment when he can strike.
