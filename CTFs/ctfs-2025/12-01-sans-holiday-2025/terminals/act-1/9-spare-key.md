You want me to say what exactly? Do I really look like someone who says MOOO?
The Neighborhood HOA hosts a static website on Azure Storage.
An admin accidentally uploaded an infrastructure config file that contains a long-lived SAS token.
Use Azure CLI to find the leak and report exactly where it lives.
```


```
🎄 Welcome to the Spare Key! 🎄
You're connected to a read-only Azure CLI session in "The Neighborhood" tenant.
Your mission: Someone left a spare key out in the open. Find WHERE it is.
Connecting you now... ❄️
```

```

Let's start by listing all resource groups
$ az group list -o table
This will show all resource groups in a readable table format.


az group list -o table
Name                 Location    ProvisioningState
-------------------  ----------  -------------------
rg-the-neighborhood  eastus      Succeeded
rg-hoa-maintenance   eastus      Succeeded
rg-hoa-clubhouse     eastus      Succeeded
rg-hoa-security      eastus      Succeeded
rg-hoa-landscaping   eastus      Succeeded
```


```
Now let's find storage accounts in the neighborhood resource group 📦
$ az storage account list --resource-group rg-the-neighborhood -o table
This shows what storage accounts exist and their types.


az storage account list --resource-group rg-the-neighborhood -o table
Name             Kind         Location    ResourceGroup        ProvisioningState
---------------  -----------  ----------  -------------------  -------------------
neighborhoodhoa  StorageV2    eastus      rg-the-neighborhood  Succeeded
hoamaintenance   StorageV2    eastus      rg-hoa-maintenance   Succeeded
hoaclubhouse     StorageV2    eastus      rg-hoa-clubhouse     Succeeded
hoasecurity      BlobStorage  eastus      rg-hoa-security      Succeeded
hoalandscaping   StorageV2    eastus      rg-hoa-landscaping   Succeeded
```

```
Someone mentioned there was a website in here.
maybe a static website?
try:$ az storage blob service-properties show --account-name <insert_account_name> --auth-mode login


az storage blob service-properties show --account-name neighborhoodhoa --auth-mode login
{
  "enabled": true,
  "errorDocument404Path": "404.html",
  "indexDocument": "index.html"
}
```

```
Let's see what 📦 containers exist in the storage account
💡 Hint: You will need to use az storage container list
We want to list the container and its public access levels.


az storage container list --account-name neighborhoodhoa --auth-mode login
[
  {
    "name": "$web",
    "properties": {
      "lastModified": "2025-09-20T10:30:00Z",
      "publicAccess": null
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "public",
    "properties": {
      "lastModified": "2025-09-15T14:20:00Z",
      "publicAccess": "Blob"
    }
  }
]


```

```
Examine what files are in the static website container
💡 hint: when using --container-name you might need '<name>'
Look 👀 for any files that shouldn't be publicly accessible!

az storage blob list --container-name "\$web" --account-name neighborhoodhoa --auth-mode login
[
  {
    "name": "index.html",
    "properties": {
      "contentLength": 512,
      "contentType": "text/html",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "hoa-website"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "about.html",
    "properties": {
      "contentLength": 384,
      "contentType": "text/html",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "hoa-website"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "iac/terraform.tfvars",
    "properties": {
      "contentLength": 1024,
      "contentType": "text/plain",
      "metadata": {
        "WARNING": "LEAKED_SECRETS"
      }
    }
  }
]


```

```
Take a look at the files here, what stands out?
Try examining a suspect file 🕵️:
💡 hint: --file /dev/stdout | less will print to your terminal 💻.


az storage blob download \
    --account-name neighborhoodhoa \
    --container-name "\$web" \
    --name "iac/terraform.tfvars" \
    --file /dev/stdout | less
