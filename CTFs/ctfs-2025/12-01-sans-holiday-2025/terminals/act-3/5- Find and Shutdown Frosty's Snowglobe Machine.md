## Find and Shutdown Frosty's Snowglobe Machine

_Difficulty:_ 

When playing through HHC 2025 in the traditional world mode, you'd have to find your way through a maze in the Data Center, similar to HHC 2015. But, since that is mostly for fun and story, and since you're playing CTF mode, you don't have to! Just click on the item below to progress through this step, which involves finding Frosty's Snowglobe Machine and shutting it down.

Items:

Snow Crystal
A crystal powered by holiday magic. Legend has it this crystal manifests its owner's most-desired gift during the holiday season. In Frosty's case, that gift was the power to cover the city in snow forever. Hm... didn't something similar happen in a movie once?

Hints

A Code in the Dark, You Must Find
From: Elder Gnome
Objective: Find and Shutdown Frosty's Snowglobe Machine
The Elder Gnome said the route to the old secret lab inside the Data Center starts on the far East wing inside the building, and that the hallways leading to it are probably pitch dark. He also said the employees that used to work there left some kind of code outside the building as a reminder of the route. Perhaps you can search in the vicinity of the Data Center for this code.

Backwards, You Should Look
From: Elder Gnome
Objective: Find and Shutdown Frosty's Snowglobe Machine
The Elder also recalled a story of another "computer person" like yourself who managed to find an intern that got lost inside the Data Center about 10 years ago. But that was before the reconstruction, so the current route likely isn't exactly the same. Maybe you can search for the Data Center's past in the historical archives that is the Internet for more information that may be helpful.
