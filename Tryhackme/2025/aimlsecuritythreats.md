Learn AI basics, key terms, and how it's used by both attackers and defenders.

# Task 1 Introduction

The world is changing; industries are coming to terms with the reality of how they will be affected by Artificial Intelligence (AI), and cyber security is no different. It should come as no surprise that Artificial Intelligence is at the heart of many discussions in the cyber security industry. A lot of ongoing research is being done to answer the questions so many have at this point in time. This room aims to answer these questions:

- What is AI/ Machine Learning (ML)?
- How can it be used in our industry?
- How will it affect my role?
- How is AI being leveraged by Attackers?

 This intro room aims to ease you into the world of AI so that you can leave with a better understanding of how the technology works and its implications for this industry and the world as a whole.

Learning Prerequisites 

This room doesn’t require any previous rooms or modules to be completed and is intended to be an entry point in learning about AI. However, knowledge of cyber security basics, such as common attacks, is assumed.

Learning Objectives 

- Understand AI, ML, and their impact on the cyber security industry.
- Understand Deep Learning (DL) and neural networks, and how they have made the applications of AI, we see today, possible. 
- Understand how adversaries use AI to enhance existing attacks and take. advantage of AI Model vulnerabilities.
- Understand the key role AI will play in defending against AI.
