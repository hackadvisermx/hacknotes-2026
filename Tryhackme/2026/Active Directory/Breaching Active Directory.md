# Breaching Active Directory

This network covers techniques and tools that can be used to acquire that first set of AD credentials that can then be used to enumerate AD.

# Task 1 Introduction to AD Breaches

Active Directory (AD) is used by approximately 90% of the Global Fortune 1000 companies. If an organisation's estate uses Microsoft Windows, you are almost guaranteed to find AD. Microsoft AD is the dominant suite used to manage Windows domain networks. However, since AD is used for Identity and Access Management of the entire estate, it holds the keys to the kingdom, making it a very likely target for attackers.

For a more in-depth understanding of AD and how it works, [please complete this room on AD basics first.](https://tryhackme.com/jr/winadbasics)

**Breaching Active Directory**

Before we can exploit AD misconfigurations for privilege escalation, lateral movement, and goal execution, you need initial access first. You need to acquire an initial set of valid AD credentials. Due to the number of AD services and features, the attack surface for gaining an initial set of AD credentials is usually significant. In this room, we will discuss several avenues, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.

When looking for that first set of credentials, we don't focus on the permissions associated with the account; thus, even a low-privileged account would be sufficient. We are just looking for a way to authenticate to AD, allowing us to do further enumeration on AD itself.

**Learning** Objectives

In this network, we will cover several methods that can be used to breach AD. This is by no means a complete list as new methods and techniques are discovered every day. However, we will  cover the following techniques to recover AD credentials in this network:

- NTLM Authenticated Services
- LDAP Bind Credentials
- Authentication Relays
- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
- Configuration Files

We can use these techniques on a security assessment either by targeting systems of an organisation that are internet-facing or by implanting a rogue device on the organisation's network.

Connecting to the Network

**AttackBox**

If you are using the Web-based AttackBox, you will be connected to the network automatically if you start the AttackBox from the room's page. You can verify this by running the ping command against the IP of the THMDC.za.tryhackme.com host. We do still need to configure DNS, however. Windows Networks use the Domain Name Service (DNS) to resolve hostnames to IPs. Throughout this network, DNS will be used for the tasks. You will have to configure DNS on the host on which you are running the VPN connection. In order to configure our DNS, run the following command:

Terminal

```shell-session
[thm@thm]$ sed -i '1s|^|nameserver THMDCIP\n|' /etc/resolv-dnsmasq
```

Remember to replace THMDCIP with the IP of THMDC in your network diagram. Once done, make sure to restart the DNS service using `systemctl restart dnsmasq`. You can test that DNS is working by running:

`nslookup thmdc.za.tryhackme.com`

This should resolve to the IP of your DC.

**Note: DNS may be reset on the AttackBox roughly every 3 hours. If this occurs, you will have to rerun the command specified above. If your AttackBox terminates and you continue with the room at a later stage, you will have to redo all the DNS steps.**

You should also take the time to make note of your VPN IP. Using `ifconfig` or `ip a`, make note of the IP of the **breachad** network adapter. This is your IP and the associated interface that you should use when performing the attacks in the tasks.

**Other Host**s
If you are going to use your own attack machine, an OpenVPN configuration file will have been generated for you once you join the room. Go to your [access](https://tryhackme.com/access) page. Select 'BreachingAD' from the VPN servers (under the network tab) and download your configuration file.

Use an OpenVPN client to connect. This example is shown on a Linux machine; similar guides to connect using Windows or macOS can be found at your [access](https://tryhackme.com/access) page.

Terminal

```shell-session

```

The message "Initialization Sequence Completed" tells you that you are now connected to the network. Return to your access page. You can verify you are connected by looking on your access page. Refresh the page, and you should see a green tick next to Connected. It will also show you your internal IP address.

**Note:** You still have to configure DNS similar to what was shown above. It is important to note that although not used, the DC does log DNS requests. If you are using your own machine, these logs may include the hostname of your device. For example, if you run the VPN on your kali machine with the hostname of kali, this will be logged.

**Kali**

If you are using a Kali VM, Network Manager is most likely used as DNS manager. You can use GUI Menu to configure DNS:

- Network Manager -> Advanced Network Configuration -> Your Connection -> IPv4 Settings
- Set your DNS IP here to the IP for THMDC in the network diagram above
- Add another DNS such as 1.1.1.1 or similar to ensure you still have internet access
- Run `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager` and test your DNS similar to the steps above.

**Debugging DNS**

DNS will be a part of Active Directory testing whether you like it or not. This is because one of the two major AD authentication protocols, Kerberos, relies on DNS to create tickets. Tickets cannot be associated with IPs, so DNS is a must. If you are going to test AD networks on a security assessment, you will have to equip yourself with the skills required to solve DNS issues. Therefore, you usually have two options:

- You can hardcode DNS entries into your `/etc/hosts` file. While this may work well, it is infeasible when you will be testing networks that have more than 10000 hosts.
- You can spend the time required to debug the DNS issue to get it working. While this may be harder, in the long run, it will yield you better results.

Whenever one of the tasks within this room is not working for you, your first thought should be: _Is my DNS working?_  From experience, I, the creator of this network, can tell you that I've wasted countless hours on assessments wondering why my tooling is not working, only to realise that my DNS has changed.

Whenever you think that your DNS configuration might not be working as it should, follow these steps to do some debugging:

1. Follow the steps provided above. Make sure to follow the steps for your specific machine type.- If you use a completely different OS, you will have to do some googling to find your equivalent configuration.
2. Run `ping <THM DC IP>` - This will verify that the network is active. If you do not get a response from the ping, it means that the network is not currently active. If your network says that it is running after you have refreshed the room page and you still get no ping response, contact THM support but simply waiting for the network timer to run out before starting the network again will fix the issue.
3. Run `nslookup za.tryhackme.com <THM DC IP>` - This will verify that the DNS server within the network is active, as the domain controller has this functional role. If the ping command worked but this does not, time to contact support since there is something wrong. It is also suggested to hit the network reset button.
4. Finally, run `nslookup tryhackme.com` - If you now get a different response than the one in step three, it means there is something wrong with your DNS configuration. Go back to the configuration steps at the start of the task and follow them again. A common issue seen on Kali is that the DNS entry is placed as the second one in your `/etc/resolv.conf` file. By making it the first entry, it will resolve the issue.

These AD networks are rated medium, which means if you just joined THM, this is probably not where you should start your learning journey. AD is massive and you will need to apply the mindset of _figuring stuff_ _out_ if you want to make a success of testing it. However, if all of the above still fails, please be as descriptive as possible on what you are trying to do when you contact support, to allow them to help you as efficiently as possible.

# Task 2 OSINT and Phishing

Two popular methods for gaining access to that first set of AD credentials is Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Phishing. We will only briefly mention the two methods here, as they are already covered more in-depth in other rooms.  

**OSINT**

OSINT is used to discover information that has been publicly disclosed. In terms of AD credentials, this can happen for several reasons, such as:

- Users who ask questions on public forums such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) but disclose sensitive information such as their credentials in the question.
- Developers that upload scripts to services such as [Github](https://github.com/) with credentials hardcoded.
- Credentials being disclosed in past breaches since employees used their work accounts to sign up for other external websites. Websites such as [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and [DeHashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) provide excellent platforms to determine if someone's information, such as work email, was ever involved in a publicly known data breach.  
    
By using OSINT techniques, it may be possible to recover publicly disclosed credentials. If we are lucky enough to find credentials, we will still need to find a way to test whether they are valid or not since OSINT information can be outdated. In Task 3, we will talk about NTLM Authenticated Services, which may provide an excellent avenue to test credentials to see if they are still valid.

A detailed room on Red Team OSINT can be found [here.](https://tryhackme.com/jr/redteamrecon)

**Phishing**

Phishing is another excellent method to breach AD. Phishing usually entices users to either provide their credentials on a malicious web page or ask them to run a specific application that would install a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) in the background. This is a prevalent method since the RAT would execute in the user's context, immediately allowing you to impersonate that user's AD account. This is why phishing is such a big topic for both Red and Blue teams.

# Task 3 NTLM Authenticated Services

Download Task Files

NTLM and NetNTLM  

New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is the suite of security protocols used to authenticate users' identities in AD. NTLM can be used for authentication by using a challenge-response-based scheme called NetNTLM. This authentication mechanism is heavily used by the services on a network. However, services that use NetNTLM can also be exposed to the internet. The following are some of the popular examples:

- Internally-hosted Exchange (Mail) servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal.
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service of a server being exposed to the internet.
- Exposed VPN endpoints that were integrated with AD.
- Web applications that are internet-facing and make use of NetNTLM.  
    

NetNTLM, also often referred to as Windows Authentication or just NTLM Authentication, allows the application to play the role of a middle man between the client and AD. All authentication material is forwarded to a Domain Controller in the form of a challenge, and if completed successfully, the application will authenticate the user.

This means that the application is authenticating on behalf of the user and not authenticating the user directly on the application itself. This prevents the application from storing AD credentials, which should only be stored on a Domain Controller. This process is shown in the diagram below:

Brute-force Login Attacks  

As mentioned in Task 2, these exposed services provide an excellent location to test credentials discovered using other means. However, these services can also be used directly in an attempt to recover an initial set of valid AD credentials. We could perhaps try to use these for brute force attacks if we recovered information such as valid email addresses during our initial red team recon.

Since most AD environments have account lockout configured, we won't be able to run a full brute-force attack. Instead, we need to perform a password spraying attack. Instead of trying multiple different passwords, which may trigger the account lockout mechanism, we choose and use one password and attempt to authenticate with all the usernames we have acquired. However, it should be noted that these types of attacks can be detected due to the amount of failed authentication attempts they will generate.  

You have been provided with a list of usernames discovered during a red team OSINT exercise. The OSINT exercise also indicated the organisation's initial onboarding password, which seems to be "Changeme123". Although users should always change their initial password, we know that users often forget. We will be using a custom-developed script to stage a password spraying against the web application hosted at this URL: [http://ntlmauth.za.tryhackme.com](http://ntlmauth.za.tryhackme.com/).

Navigating to the URL, we can see that it prompts us for Windows Authentication credentials:

**Note:** _Firefox's Windows Authentication plugin is incredibly prone to failure. If you want to test credentials manually, Chrome is recommended._

We could use tools such as [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) to assist with the password spraying attack. However, it is often better to script up these types of attacks yourself, which allows you more control over the process. A base python script has been provided in the task files that can be used for the password spraying attack. The following function is the main component of the script:

```python
def password_spray(self, password, url):
    print ("[*] Starting passwords spray attack using the following password: " + password)
    #Reset valid credential counter
    count = 0
    #Iterate through all of the possible usernames
    for user in self.users:
        #Make a request to the website and attempt Windows Authentication
        response = requests.get(url, auth=HttpNtlmAuth(self.fqdn + "\\" + user, password))
        #Read status code of response to determine if authentication was successful
        if (response.status_code == self.HTTP_AUTH_SUCCEED_CODE):
            print ("[+] Valid credential pair found! Username: " + user + " Password: " + password)
            count += 1
            continue
        if (self.verbose):
            if (response.status_code == self.HTTP_AUTH_FAILED_CODE):
                print ("[-] Failed login with Username: " + user)
    print ("[*] Password spray attack completed, " + str(count) + " valid credential pairs found")
```

This function takes our suggested password and the URL that we are targeting as input and attempts to authenticate to the URL with each username in the textfile. By monitoring the differences in HTTP response codes from the application, we can determine if the credential pair is valid or not. If the credential pair is valid, the application would respond with a 200 HTTP (OK) code. If the pair is invalid, the application will return a 401 HTTP (Unauthorised) code.
